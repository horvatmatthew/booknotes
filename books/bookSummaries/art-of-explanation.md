# *The Art of Explanation* – Expanded Summary

**By Ros Atkins**

## Overview

*The Art of Explanation* is a practical and thoughtful guide to communicating clearly and effectively in a world overwhelmed by information. Drawing on his career as a BBC journalist and presenter, Ros Atkins argues that explanation is one of the most important skills in modern life—one that affects success in work, education, leadership, and everyday interactions. Rather than treating explanation as a natural talent or stylistic flourish, Atkins presents it as a learnable craft built on structure, preparation, and audience awareness.

The book addresses a common frustration: explanations often fail. Presentations lose attention, emails cause confusion, essays lack focus, and conversations do not lead to action. Atkins suggests these failures are rarely due to a lack of intelligence or effort, but instead stem from an absence of method. In an environment saturated with competing messages and constant distractions, explanation must be deliberate, efficient, and purposeful to succeed.

## What Makes a Good Explanation

Atkins begins by defining the core attributes of a strong explanation. These include:

* **Simplicity of language**
* **Essential detail**
* **Engagement with complexity**
* **Efficiency**
* **Precision**
* **Context**
* **Usefulness**
* **Clarity of purpose**

A central idea is the removal of “obstacles to understanding.” These obstacles include jargon, unnecessary detail, long or tangled sentences, and information that may be interesting but is not relevant to the audience’s needs. Atkins stresses that simplicity does not mean oversimplification. Rather, it means choosing the clearest possible words and structures so that meaning is not obscured.

At the same time, Atkins warns against avoiding complexity. Many important subjects—such as politics, economics, health, or organisational change—are inherently complex. Ignoring or glossing over this complexity undermines trust and comprehension. Effective explanation requires the explainer to fully understand the complexity first, even if only part of it is ultimately shared. Deep understanding enables better judgement about what information is essential and how it should be presented.

## The Importance of the Audience

A recurring theme throughout the book is that explanation is never one-size-fits-all. Atkins emphasises that no explanation exists in a vacuum; it must be shaped by the audience. What people already know, what they need to know, how much time they have, and what they are expected to do with the information all influence how something should be explained.

Many failed explanations, Atkins argues, stem from assumptions about shared knowledge or interest. By actively considering the audience—rather than defaulting to the explainer’s own perspective—communication becomes more focused, relevant, and persuasive. Audience awareness is therefore not an optional extra but a core component of effective explanation.

## The Seven-Step Explanation System

At the heart of the book is Atkins’s **Seven-Step Explanation** method, a structured process designed to help people explain anything clearly and effectively. While flexible in application, the system typically involves:

1. Defining the purpose of the explanation
2. Gathering relevant information
3. Distilling what is essential
4. Organising ideas logically
5. Linking information clearly
6. Tightening language
7. Delivering the explanation effectively

This method can be used for substantial tasks such as presentations, speeches, essays, reports, or pitches. Atkins also introduces a **Seven-Step Dynamic Explanation**, adapted for live and unpredictable situations such as interviews, meetings, negotiations, or panel discussions. In these contexts, preparation supports clarity and flexibility rather than rigid scripting.

## Quick Explanations and Everyday Communication

Recognising that many explanations happen under time pressure, Atkins devotes attention to **quick explanations**—short verbal exchanges and written communication such as emails, messages, or brief conversations. He argues that these moments are especially important because they are so frequent and often shape everyday efficiency and relationships.

Even in short explanations, clarity of purpose and structure can significantly reduce misunderstanding, save time, and improve outcomes. Done well, these small interactions can be as transformative as more formal communication.

## Explanation as a Tool for Better Thinking

Throughout the book, Atkins uses examples from journalism, leadership, education, healthcare, and his own career to demonstrate the power of explanation. He reflects not only on successes but also on missed opportunities caused by poor explanation, reinforcing the idea that explanation is a skill developed through reflection and practice.

One of the book’s most important insights is that explanation improves thinking itself. The discipline of preparing to explain forces clearer prioritisation, stronger reasoning, and sharper focus. As a result, explanation does not merely transmit ideas—it refines them. In this sense, explanation becomes central to decision-making, leadership, and learning.

## Conclusion

*The Art of Explanation* positions explanation as a foundational life skill rather than a specialist one. Atkins does not promise perfect communication, acknowledging that explanation is an art rather than a science. Instead, he offers practical tools and a flexible framework that give ideas their best possible chance of being understood.

By focusing on clarity, audience awareness, structure, and purpose, the book empowers readers to communicate more confidently and effectively—whether in high-stakes professional moments or everyday interactions.
